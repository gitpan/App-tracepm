=head1 NAME

tracepm - tracepm

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.09 of tracepm (from Perl distribution App-tracepm), released on 2014-12-04.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage:

 % tracepm [options] <script> [args]

=head1 OPTIONS

C<*> marks required options.

=head2 Field-selection options

=over

=item B<--detail>

Whether to return records instead of just module names.

=back

=head2 Filtering options

=over

=item B<--core>

Filter only modules that are in core.

=item B<--xs>

Filter only modules that are XS modules.

=back

=head2 General options

=over

=item B<--args-json>=I<s>

Script arguments (JSON-encoded).

See C<--args>.

=item B<--args>=I<s@>

Script arguments.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--cache-prereqscanner>

Whether cache Perl::PrereqScanner{,::Lite} result.

=item B<--config-path>=I<s>

Set path to configuration file.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--config-profile>=I<s>

Set configuration profile to use.

=item B<--debug>

Set log level to 'debug'.

=item B<--format>=I<s>

Set output format.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-?>

Show help message.

=item B<--json>

Set output format to json.

=item B<--log-level>=I<s>

Set log level.

=item B<--method>=I<s>

Tracing method to use.

Default value:

 "fatpacker"

Valid values:

 ["fatpacker", "require", "prereqscanner", "prereqscanner_lite", "prereqscanner_recurse", "prereqscanner_lite_recurse"]

There are several tracing methods that can be used:

* `fatpacker` (the default): This method uses the same method that `fatpacker
  trace` uses, which is running the script using `perl -c` then collect the
  populated `%INC`. Only modules loaded during compile time are detected.

* `require`: This method runs your script normally until it exits. At the start
  of program, it replaces `CORE::GLOBAL::require()` with a routine that logs the
  require() argument to the log file. Modules loaded during runtime is also
  logged by this method. But some modules might not work, specifically modules
  that also overrides require() (there should be only a handful of modules that
  do this though).

* `prereqscanner`: This method does not run your Perl program, but statically
  analyze it using `Perl::PrereqScanner`. Since it uses `PPI`, it can be rather
  slow.

* `prereqscanner_recurse`: Like `prereqscanner`, but will recurse into all
  non-core modules until they are exhausted. Modules that are not found will be
  skipped. It is recommended to use the various `recurse_exclude_*` options
  options to limit recursion.

* `prereqscanner_lite`: This method is like the `prereqscanner` method, but
  instead of `Perl::PrereqScanner` it uses `Perl::PrereqScanner::Lite`. The
  latter does not use `PPI` but use `Compiler::Lexer` which is significantly
  faster.

* `prereqscanner_lite_recurse`: Like `prereqscanner_lite`, but recurses.


=item B<--naked-res>

When outputing as JSON, strip result envelope.

By default, when outputing as JSON, the full enveloped result is returned, e.g.:

    [200,"OK",[1,2,3],{"func.extra"=>4}]

The reason is so you can get the status (1st element), status message (2nd
element) as well as result metadata/extra result (4th element) instead of just
the result (3rd element). However, sometimes you want just the result, e.g. when
you want to pipe the result for more post-processing:

    [1,2,3]

In this case, you can use `--naked-res`.


=item B<--no-config>

Do not use any configuration file.

=item B<--perl-version>=I<s>, B<-V>

Perl version, defaults to current running version.

This is for determining which module is core (the list differs from version to
version. See Module::CoreList for more details.


=item B<--quiet>

Set log level to 'error'.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-core>

When recursing, exclude core modules.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-json>=I<s>

When recursing, exclude some modules (JSON-encoded).

See C<--recurse-exclude>.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-pattern-json>=I<s>

When recursing, exclude some module patterns (JSON-encoded).

See C<--recurse-exclude-pattern>.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-pattern>=I<s@>

When recursing, exclude some module patterns.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--recurse-exclude-xs>

When recursing, exclude XS modules.

=item B<--recurse-exclude>=I<s@>

When recursing, exclude some modules.

Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--script>=I<s>*

Path to script file (script to be packed).

=item B<--trace>

Set log level to 'trace'.

=item B<--use-json>=I<s>

Additional modules to "use" (JSON-encoded).

See C<--use>.

=item B<--use>=I<s@>

Additional modules to "use".

This is like running:

    perl -MModule1 -MModule2 script.pl


Can be specified multiple times.

=item B<--verbose>

Set log level to 'info'.

=item B<--version>, B<-v>

Show program version.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C tracepm tracepm

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Perinci::CmdLine-based scripts. After you install the module and put C<. ~/.bash-complete-prog> (or C<. /etc/bash-complete-prog>), you can just run C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added to your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.

=head2 fish

To activate fish completion for this script, execute:

 begin; set -lx COMP_SHELL fish; set -lx COMP_MODE gen_command; tracepm; end > $HOME/.config/fish/completions/tracepm.fish

Or if you want to install globally, you can instead write the generated script to C</etc/fish/completions/tracepm.fish> or C</usr/share/fish/completions/tracepm.fish>. The exact path might be different on your system. Please check your C<fish_complete_path> variable.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete tracepm 'p/*/`tracepm`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

=head2 zsh

To activate zsh completion for this script, put:

 _tracepm() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_SHELL=zsh COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" tracepm`) }

 compctl -K _tracepm tracepm

in your zsh startup (e.g. C<~/.zshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.
